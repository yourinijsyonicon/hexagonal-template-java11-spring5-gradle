# Hexagonal Template

This is a very limited base setup for a hexagonal structured application architecture with Spring 5 (Spring Boot 2), java 11 and gradle.

This setup is free to use. Other tutorials, guides, workshops and training material is available. For more info, contact me at [Web](https://yourinijsyonicon.github.io/) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/youri-nijs-yonicon/)
